## üìù **Implementation Notes:**

The current application has a solid foundation with:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- NextAuth.js authentication
- TanStack Query for state management
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Static golf course database (150+ Ohio courses)

Adding real-time features and enhanced social functionality would significantly improve user engagement and retention.
