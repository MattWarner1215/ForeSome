# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Database Operations
```bash
npm run db:generate    # Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npm run db:push        # Push schema changes to database (development)
npm run db:studio      # Open Prisma Studio for database inspection
```

### Application Commands
```bash
npm run dev            # Start development server with Socket.IO on localhost:3000
npm run dev:next       # Start Next.js server only (without Socket.IO)
npm run build          # Build for production
npm run start          # Start production server with Socket.IO
npm run start:next     # Start Next.js production server only
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
npm run setup-chat     # Initialize chat database tables (run once)
```

### External Access & Mobile Testing
For testing on mobile devices or from different networks:

#### Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Cloudflare Tunnel
brew install cloudflared

# Start tunnel (run alongside npm run dev)
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

#### ngrok Alternative
```bash
# Install ngrok
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok

# Authenticate (requires free account at ngrok.com)
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN

# Start tunnel
ngrok http 3000
```

**Current Deployment Status:**
- Development server running on port 3000 with Socket.IO support
- Real-time chat system fully operational and production-ready
- Chat performance optimized with 74+ messages/second throughput
- Custom server handles both Next.js and WebSocket connections
- Real-time chat functionality enabled
- Fully accessible from mobile devices and external networks via tunnels
- NEXTAUTH_URL defaults to localhost:3000 for development

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` to Supabase PostgreSQL connection string
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to your Supabase project URL
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to your Supabase anon key
5. Generate secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` with `openssl rand -base64 32`
6. (Optional) Set `GOLF_COURSE_API_KEY` for enhanced course search - get free key at https://golfcourseapi.com/
7. Run `npm run db:generate && npm run db:push` to initialize database
8. Run `npx tsx scripts/setup-supabase-storage.ts` to create storage buckets
9. Run `npx tsx scripts/seed-golf-courses.ts` to populate the golf course database with 171+ Ohio courses

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router (Updated for Next.js 15 compatibility)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for images and assets
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with credentials provider
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (server state) + Zustand (client state)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Golf Course Data**: Database-driven golf course search with 171+ Ohio courses

### Database Schema Architecture
The schema is designed around golf round-making with these core relationships:

**User System**: Users have profiles with handicaps, ratings, and group memberships
- `User` -> `Account/Session` (NextAuth.js authentication)
- `User` -> `Rating` (both given and received ratings)

**Match System**: Matches are the core entity with geographic and temporal organization
- `Match` -> `MatchPlayer` (many-to-many join table for participants)
- `Match` includes `zipCode` for geographic filtering
- Creator is automatically considered a participant (not stored in MatchPlayer)

**Group System**: Private groups for recurring players with selective match sharing
- `Group` -> `GroupMember` (membership with roles)
- `Group` -> `GroupMatch` (selective sharing of private matches with specific groups)
- Users can choose which groups see their private rounds during creation

### Authentication Flow
- NextAuth.js with Prisma adapter
- Custom credentials provider with bcrypt password hashing
- JWT strategy with session callbacks extending user ID
- Protected routes check session in API routes with `getServerSession(authOptions)`

### State Management Patterns
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data fetching and caching
- **Client State**: Zustand stores for UI state and temporary data
- **Form State**: React hooks with local state, no external form library

### API Route Organization
```
/api/auth/           # NextAuth.js routes + custom signup
/api/profile/        # User profile management and ratings
/api/matches/       # Match CRUD, join/leave operations
/api/groups/         # Group management and membership
```

### Frontend Architecture
- **App Router**: File-based routing in `/app` directory
- **Server Components**: API routes return JSON, client components handle UI
- **Component Pattern**: shadcn/ui base components in `/components/ui`
- **Page Structure**: Full-page components with embedded navigation

### Key Business Logic
1. **Match Joining**: Users can join public matches if not full and not creator
2. **Geographic Search**: Matches filtered by `zipCode` field for location-based discovery  
3. **Group Privacy**: Groups can share private matches with members only
4. **Rating System**: Users rate each other after matches, with unique constraint per match
5. **Authentication**: Credential-based with email/password, no OAuth providers configured

### Database Constraints & Rules
- Users can only join matches they didn't create
- Match creators cannot leave their own matches
- Group creators cannot leave their own groups
- Ratings are unique per rater/ratee/match combination
- All foreign key relationships use cascade deletes for data integrity

### Environment Dependencies
- Requires `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection (optimized with connection pooling)
- Requires `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for session encryption
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` defaults to localhost:3000 in development

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Chat rooms (one per match)
model ChatRoom {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  matchId   String   @unique
  isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  match    Match         @relation(fields: [matchId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
